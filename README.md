# Invadors

Easy to use, it will make you more attractive and you feel sensual doing so.

A Love2d platformer game prototype I wrote to learn more about game programming while travelling Europe.

## Installation / Starting the Game

```
git clone git@github.com:mikelyons/invadors.git
```

Then inside the `invadors` directory:

there are 3 run.bat files that do different things for different platforms

#### Windows

- `run1.bat` starts the game in LOVE 10.2
- `run2.bat` starts the game in LOVE 11.3
- `run3.bat` starts the game in LOVE 10.2 with color terminal logging (windows only)

#### MacOS

- `run.command`  starts with 10.2
- `run2.command` starts with 11.3

MacOS may not support color terminal logging

Continuing development during the 2020 pandemic

## What I've Learned

* Tilemaps and sprites
* How to roll you own basic 2D collisions
* Edge cases when applying gravity
* How gravity is simulated in a non-realistic fashion in platformer games
* Common pitfalls and the importance of optimisation in videogames
* Created a mini-map UI with the relative position of the player and the world elements
* Splash screens and audio
* Lots about Love2d! (will explain in a later update)
