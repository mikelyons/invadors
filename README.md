# Invadors

A Love2d platformer game prototype I wrote to learn more about game programming while travelling Europe.

**Update**: 0.4.2 - development started again with a big cleanup

# What I Learned

* Tilemaps and sprites
* How to roll you own basic 2D collisions
* Edge cases when applying gravity
* How gravity is simulated in a non-realistic fashion in platformer games
* Common pitfalls and the importance of optimisation in videogames
* Created a mini-map UI with the relative position of the player and the world elements
* Splash screens and audio
* Lots about Love2d! (will explain in a later update)
